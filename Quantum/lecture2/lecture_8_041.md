## Lecture 1: Introduction to Superposition

### 1. The Motivation
	•	Classical physics (Newton + Maxwell) works incredibly well for macroscopic systems, but fails for microscopic systems like electrons, atoms, and photons.
	•	Quantum mechanics is required to explain observed experimental facts such as atomic spectra, interference, and the photoelectric effect.

⸻

### 2. The Principle of Superposition
	•	Core idea:

If a system can be in state $${|A\rangle}$$ and also in state $${|B\rangle}$$, then it can exist in a superposition:

$${|\psi\rangle = c_A |A\rangle + c_B |B\rangle}$$
where c_A, c_B are complex numbers called amplitudes.
	•	This is not just a probability mixture (like a coin flip) — the amplitudes can interfere.

⸻

### 3. Probabilities and Amplitudes
	•	In quantum mechanics, amplitudes are fundamental, not probabilities.
	•	The Born Rule: probability of an outcome = squared magnitude of amplitude.
$${P(A) = |c_A|^2, \quad P(B) = |c_B|^2}$$
	•	Interference arises because amplitudes can add and cancel due to their phase.

⸻

### 4. Double-Slit Experiment (Preview of Quantum Weirdness)
	•	Classically:
	•	Particles (e.g. bullets) → two distinct bands.
	•	Waves (e.g. water waves) → interference fringes.
	•	Quantum mechanically:
	•	Individual electrons arrive one at a time, but over time they build up an interference pattern.
	•	The superposition principle is the explanation: each electron takes both paths, and the amplitudes interfere.

⸻

### 5. Measurement
	•	Measurement “collapses” the superposition into a definite outcome.
	•	Before measurement: the system is in a linear combination of states.
	•	After measurement: we only observe one result, with probability given by amplitude squared.

⸻

### 6. Big Idea
	•	Quantum mechanics = superposition + measurement rules.
	•	Everything else (wavefunctions, Schrödinger equation, operators) is built on top of this principle.

⸻

✅ Key Takeaway:
Quantum systems are not just “in one state or another.” They exist in superpositions of states, and the interference of amplitudes (not probabilities) is what makes quantum physics fundamentally different from classical physics.

Do you want me to also make a Lecture 1 + Lecture 2 combined cheat sheet, so you can see the “superposition principle” connected directly to the “experimental facts of life”?
