This code simulates the double-slit experiment, a fundamental demonstration of quantum mechanics. It calculates the interference pattern formed on a screen when particles (like electrons or photons) pass through two slits. The resulting plot shows the probability distribution of detecting a particle at various positions on the screen, illustrating the wave-like behavior of particles in quantum mechanics.

Key Concepts Illustrated:
1. Wave-Particle Duality: The code demonstrates how particles exhibit wave-like interference patterns.
2. Superposition Principle: The total amplitude at each point on the screen is the sum of amplitudes from both slits.
3. Probability Amplitude: The probability of detecting a particle is related to the square of the amplitude.
4. Phase Difference: The phase difference between the two paths leads to constructive and destructive interference, shaping the probability distribution.
5. Measurement Effect: The code includes an option to simulate a measurement that collapses the wavefunction, resulting in no interference pattern.

To run this code, ensure you have Python installed along with the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:
