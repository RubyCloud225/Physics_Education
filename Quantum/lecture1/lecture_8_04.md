## Key Experimental Facts from Lecture 2: “Existence of Life” (Experimental Facts of Life)

### 1. Atoms Exist: Evidence for Electrons & Nuclei
	•	Electrons: Their existence is confirmed through cathode ray experiments (like inside CRT displays) and observations in cloud chambers—tools that visualize charged particles  ￼.
	•	Atomic Nucleus: Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden’s scattering experiments demonstrated that atoms have dense cores. α-particles bouncing back off atoms revealed the nucleus  ￼.

### 2. Randomness in Nature
	•	Classical physics can’t account for the statistical unpredictability found in microscopic phenomena, indicating genuine randomness in nature  ￼.

### 3. Discrete Atomic Spectra
	•	Spectral lines are quantized rather than continuous. Balmer, Rydberg, and Ritz formulated mathematical relationships showing discrete wavelengths in emission spectra, highlighting quantized energy levels in atoms  ￼.

### 4. The Photoelectric Effect
	•	When light hits a metal, electrons are only emitted if the light frequency is above a certain threshold—regardless of intensity.
	•	The stopping voltage (linked to kinetic energy of electrons) scales linearly with light frequency.
	•	Einstein’s interpretation: light consists of photons with energy E = h\nu, and the kinetic energy of emitted electrons follows K = h \nu - W (W = work function). Light thus behaves as quantized packets  ￼.

### 5. Wave–Particle Duality of Light and Matter
	•	Light: While interference patterns (from double-slit experiments) demonstrate wavelike behavior, the photoelectric effect shows particle-like characteristics—revealing light’s dual nature  ￼.
	•	Electrons: In double-slit experiments, individual electrons produce interference patterns over time, a hallmark of wave behavior, suggesting electrons exhibit wave–particle duality too  ￼.

### 6. Quantization of Measurement and Interaction
	•	Attempting to determine through which slit an electron passes destroys interference, due to the quantized nature of probing interactions. Even low-energy photons disrupt coherence. This underscores that measurement itself is quantized and affects outcomes  ￼.

### 7. Electron Diffraction (de Broglie Relation)
	•	The Davisson–Germer experiment confirmed that electrons diffract like waves when passing through a crystal lattice.
	•	The de Broglie relations were established:
    
$${E = h \nu, \quad}$$ $${p = \frac{h}{\lambda}}$$

demonstrating the wave-like momentum of particles  ￼.
