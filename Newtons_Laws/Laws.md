## Newtons First Law
Newton's First Law states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This law is often referred to as the law of inertia.

$${\text{F}_net = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \text{F}_net = \}$$
$${\text{v} = \text{constant}\}$$

${\text{F}_net}$ is the net force (vector sum of all forces in newtons ) acting on an object, and ${\text{v}}$ is the velocity of the object.

## Newton's Second Law
Newton's Second Law relates the motion of an object to the force acting upon it. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass.

F = ma
where F is the net force acting on the object, m is its mass, and a is its acceleration.

Acceleration is the second derivateive of postion with respect to time.

$${\vec{a}(t) = \frac{d^2 \vec{x}(t)}{dt^2}}$$

so newtons 2nd law becomes: 

$${m \frac{d^2 \vec{x}(t)}{dt^2} = \vec{F}(t)}$$

### In example Free Fall

Force: ${\vec{F} = m \vec{g}}$, where ${\vec{g} = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2}$ downward.

Looking at the equation: 

$${m \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = mg}$$

canceling the m's we get:

$${\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = g}$$

then integrate once to get:

$${\frac{dy}{dt} = v(t) = g t + v_0}$$

then again

$${y(t) = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 + v_0 t + y_0}$$


## Newton's Third Law
Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

$${\vec{F}{AB} = - \vec{F}{BA}}$$

$${\vec{F}_{AB}}$$ force exerted by object A on object B, and $${\vec{F}_{BA}}$$ force exerted by object B on object A.
